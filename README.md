hi there. welcome to <a href="http://www.joncass.com/apps/clync">ClynC</a>.

a ClynC is a (mostly) synchronized click. when you click your red tile, your timer will start counting down. if another user clicks their red tile while your timer is running, you get points!

that's pretty much all there is to it. enjoy!
