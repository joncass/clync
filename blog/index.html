                        In the original version, when you got a ClynC (more points) a card would appear in a list in the right column.
                        This presented two problems.
                        First of all, the page height would vary dramatically as ClynCs came and went (they'd vanish after two seconds), which was jarring.
                        Secondly, there was a large visual disconnect between the score going up and the notification of it.
                        I decided to move the notification into the scoreboard to solve these two problems, and also add an animation for it to fade in and out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        AngularJS has an <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate">angular-animate package and ngAnimate feature</a>.
                        Given how easy AngularJS had been to use so far, I assumed this would be similarly painless.
                        Unfortunately, I found the documentation and examples on the AngularJS site challenging to use, and furthermore couldn't find simple examples after Googling around.
                        The closest I found was <a href="https://codepen.io/nicholaspufal/pen/wcHno">this CodePen</a>, but even that was still overcomplicated.
                        So I decided to make the simplest one I could.
                        You can see the <a href="http://codepen.io/joncass/pen/NpzNjz">CodePen here</a>, and read on for an explanation.

                    <article class="message">
                        <div class="message-body">
                            <p class="subtitle">
                                HTML
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the HTML, you first have to include the AngularJS and Angular-Animate libraries.
                                You declare your app and controller on the DOM element that will correspond with the $scope in the JavaScript.
                                Next we have a div with the ng-show attribute.
                                The value of the attribute (in this case "visibility") corresponds to an attribute of the $scope variable.
                                Initially, visibility is undefined and so the element is not shown.
                                Below this we have a button with an ng-click handler.
                                The handler switches the visibility attribute between true and false.
                                When this button is clicked, the truthiness of visibility will toggle, so the div will move between being hidden and shown.
                                Without any CSS, this would be an instantaneous transition.
                                Let's see what the CSS is doing for us.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </article>
                    <article class="message">
                        <div class="message-body">
                            <p class="subtitle">
                                CSS
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the CSS, we have two rules.
                                The first, tells us that <b>all</b> transitions on divs should last <b>.5</b> seconds.
                                The second tells us that divs with class ng-hide should have 0 opacity.
                                AngularJS will add and remove the ng-hide class for any element with an ng-show attribute (where the class will be present if the ng-show is false and vice versa).
                                When the class gets removed, the opacity will go from 0 to 1, but because of the transition rule, this will happen over time instead of instantly.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </article>
                    <article class="message">
                        <div class="message-body">
                            <p class="subtitle">
                                JS
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As you can see, the JavaScript is trivial.
                                Its purpose is simply to instantiate the app and controller so that the AngularJS infrastructure can set classes and visibility based on variables in the $scope.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </article>
                    <p>
                        So that's all there is to it.
                        Hopefully this helps the next person get animation up and running in their app.
                        Good luck!

                        I made a <a href="http://clync.me">web app</a>! This is the blog about the app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My dad gave me the seed of the idea for the ClynC app.
                        He envisioned an app where simultaneous clicks would link users in a chat.
                        Maybe with a "question of the day" to discuss.
                        As you can see, I've gone a different way with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I spent a weekend working on the prototype for ClynC.
                        It's amazing what you can accomplish in just a few days by building on top of the great frameworks out there.
                        For ClynC, I'm using
                            <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>,
                            <a href="http://bulma.io/" target="_blank">bulma.io</a>,
                            and <a href="https://www.pubnub.com/" target="_blank">PubNub</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For my JavaScript framework, I knew I wanted something simple and powerful.
                        After a bit of reading, I was down to React or AngularJS.
                        I looked at some sample code, and tried both out, and React seemed to have significantly more overhead.
                        So I decided to move forward with AngularJS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I knew I wanted to build my CSS on top of flexbox, which is a joy to use.
                        If you haven't had a chance to play with flexbox, I strongly recommend trying it out.
                        <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">This CSS-Tricks</a> article is a great starters' guide.
                        I quickly stumbled on the elegant bulma.io, which also happened to be well-documented.
                        Decision made.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, PubNub.
                        Pub/sub as a service, with no server component required?
                        Sign me up.
                        This was the easiest decision for me, as I had been looking for an excuse to play with PubNub.
                        An app that required all of the users' states to be kept in sync was a perfect candidate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, that's where I am now.
                        I'm hoping to add a bit of new functionality, and some ads, and then start getting the word out soon.
                        Thanks for reading!
