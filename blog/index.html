                        I made a <a href="http://clync.me">web app</a>! This is the blog about the app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My dad gave me the seed of the idea for the ClynC app.
                        He envisioned an app where simultaneous clicks would link users in a chat.
                        Maybe with a "question of the day" to discuss.
                        As you can see, I've gone a different way with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I spent a weekend working on the prototype for ClynC.
                        It's amazing what you can accomplish in just a few days by building on top of the great frameworks out there.
                        For ClynC, I'm using
                            <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>,
                            <a href="http://bulma.io/" target="_blank">Bulma</a>,
                            and <a href="https://www.pubnub.com/" target="_blank">PubNub</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For my JavaScript framework, I knew I wanted something simple and powerful.
                        After a bit of reading, I was down to React or AngularJS.
                        I looked at some sample code, and tried both out, and React seemed to have significantly more overhead.
                        So I decided to move forward with AngularJS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I knew I wanted to build my CSS on top of flexbox, which is a joy to use.
                        If you haven't had a chance to play with flexbox, I strongly recommend trying it out.
                        <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">This CSS-Tricks</a> article is a great starters' guide.
                        I quickly stumbled on the elegant Bulma, which also happened to be well-documented.
                        Decision made.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, PubNub.
                        Pub/sub as a service, with no server component required?
                        Sign me up.
                        This was the easiest decision for me, as I had been looking for an excuse to play with PubNub.
                        An app that required all of the users' states to be kept in sync was a perfect candidate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, that's where I am now.
                        I'm hoping to add a bit of new functionality, and some ads, and then start getting the word out soon.
                        Thanks for reading!

                        In the original version, when you got a ClynC (more points) a card would appear in a list in the right column.
                        This presented two problems.
                        First of all, the page height would vary dramatically as ClynCs came and went (they'd vanish after two seconds), which was jarring.
                        Secondly, there was a large visual disconnect between the score going up and the notification of it.
                        I decided to move the notification into the scoreboard to solve these two problems, and also add an animation for it to fade in and out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        AngularJS has an <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate">angular-animate package and ngAnimate feature</a>.
                        Given how easy AngularJS had been to use so far, I assumed this would be similarly painless.
                        Unfortunately, I found the documentation and examples on the AngularJS site challenging to use, and furthermore couldn't find simple examples after Googling around.
                        The closest I found was <a href="https://codepen.io/nicholaspufal/pen/wcHno">this CodePen</a>, but even that was still overcomplicated.
                        So I decided to make the simplest one I could.
                        You can see the <a href="http://codepen.io/joncass/pen/NpzNjz">CodePen here</a>, and read on for an explanation.
                    </p>
                    <article class="message">
                        <div class="message-body">
                            <p class="subtitle">
                                HTML
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the HTML, you first have to include the AngularJS and Angular-Animate libraries.
                                You declare your app and controller on the DOM element that will correspond with the $scope in the JavaScript.
                                Next we have a div with the ng-show attribute.
                                The value of the attribute (in this case "visibility") corresponds to an attribute of the $scope variable.
                                Initially, visibility is undefined and so the element is not shown.
                                Below this we have a button with an ng-click handler.
                                The handler switches the visibility attribute between true and false.
                                When this button is clicked, the truthiness of visibility will toggle, so the div will move between being hidden and shown.
                                Without any CSS, this would be an instantaneous transition.
                                Let's see what the CSS is doing for us.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </article>
                    <article class="message">
                        <div class="message-body">
                            <p class="subtitle">
                                CSS
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the CSS, we have two rules.
                                The first, tells us that <b>all</b> transitions on divs should last <b>.5</b> seconds.
                                The second tells us that divs with class ng-hide should have 0 opacity.
                                AngularJS will add and remove the ng-hide class for any element with an ng-show attribute (where the class will be present if the ng-show is false and vice versa).
                                When the class gets removed, the opacity will go from 0 to 1, but because of the transition rule, this will happen over time instead of instantly.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </article>
                    <article class="message">
                        <div class="message-body">
                            <p class="subtitle">
                                JS
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As you can see, the JavaScript is trivial.
                                Its purpose is simply to instantiate the app and controller so that the AngularJS infrastructure can set classes and visibility based on variables in the $scope.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                    <p>
                        So that's all there is to it.
                        Hopefully this helps the next person get animation up and running in their app.
                        Good luck!

                        My original leaderboard implementation used <a href="http://bulma.io/documentation/grid/columns/">Bulma columns</a>.
                        This had the desired effect in the desktop layout, but on the mobile layout (which stacks columns) it was unreadable.
                        I'll write more about mobile layouts in my next post, but this post will focus on how I solved the leaderboard problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I browsed the Bulma documentation and found a few elements that were workable.
                        One that jumped out at me was the <a href="http://bulma.io/documentation/elements/table/">table element</a>.
                        My gut reaction was to skip the table and move on.
                        After all, if my training as a web developer had taught me one thing it was: table bad!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But then I began to wonder.
                        What exactly is so bad about tables?
                        I brought my question to Google, and of course was rewarded with plenty of results.
                        Reading through the titles of the results, I noticed something interesting.
                        There was a definite distinction to be made between the use of tables for layout and the use of tables for, well, tabular data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It seems that there are three camps:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tables are bad.</li>
                            <li>Tables are bad for layout, but fine for tabular data.</li>
                            <li>Tables are good for everything. Or at least, better than div layouts.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After reading through some of the
                            <a href="https://www.hotdesign.com/seybold/everything.html">articles</a>,
                            <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/83073/why-not-use-tables-for-layout-in-html">forum</a>
                            <a href="https://css-tricks.com/forums/topic/are-tables-a-bad-thing/">discussions</a>,
                            and
                            <a href="http://csszengarden.com/">examples</a>,
                        I decided that using a table for my leaderboard (which is basically tabular data) would be fine.
                        However, I now understand why tables should be avoided as the core structure of a page.
                        This seems to land me squarely in the second camp.
                        If, like me, you know that "table bad" but don't really know why, I encourage you to read through them!

                        I wanted ClynC to work on many browsers and devices.
                        My hope was that by using a CSS framework like Bulma, this would be taken care of for me.
                        And, for the most part, it did just that.
                        Bulma's website has a

                        that clearly documents its mobile-first philosophy, and indeed the layout is very responsive for most screen sizes.
                        I have also seen very few cross-browser issues so far.
                        In this post I'll talk about a couple of the issues that I did see, and how I resolved them.
                    </p>
                    <article class="message">
                        <div class="message-body">
                            <p class="subtitle">
                                Column stacking
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As mentioned on Bulma's responsiveness page, its columns will automatically stack at widths under 768px.
                                I kept that in mind while I was designing the page, making sure to choose page locations for elements that would make sense in both the desktop and mobile views.
                                The two places where this did not work as well for me were the leaderboard and the footer.
                                I discussed the leaderboard issues in the <a href="#post-tables">last post</a>.
                                As for the footer, I had two concerns.
                                First of all, the left column is left-justified, the right-column is right-justified, and the center column is centered.
                                This meant that when they stacked, the footer had a weird diagonal feel.
                                And secondly, I didn't want a lot of scrolling to be required to consume the footer itself.
                                Luckily, Bulma had me covered.
                                By adding the <b>is-mobile</b> class to the footer, Bulma understood that it should remain horizontal at all widths.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </article>
                    <article class="message">
                        <div class="message-body">
                            <p class="subtitle">
                                Timer progress
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The timer has two ways of indicating the time left.
                                It has both a numerical countdown, and a progress bar.
                                The progress bar uses the new HTML5 progress element, that I had not heard of before.
                                The examples on
                                    <a href="http://bulma.io/documentation/elements/progress/">Bulma's documentation</a>
                                use the <b>value</b> attribute.
                                Since I am using AngularJS, I set it to <b>{{timer.timeLeft}}</b>.
                                This worked great on Chrome, but unfortunately did not work on Edge.
                                A quick Google search yielded the suggestion to change it from <b>value="{{timer.timeLeft}}"</b> to <b>ng-value="timer.timeLeft"</b>.
                                In other words, use explicit AngularJS binding.
                                That did the trick - it now worked in Edge!
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </article>
                    <p>
                        With those quick fixes out of the way, ClynC now works on Chrome, Safari, and Edge at most reasonable widths.
                        It doesn't look right on earlier versions of IE, due to extensive use of flexbox.
                        Additionally, I'm sure there are countless browsers, devices, screen sizes, etc that I have not tested.
                        But the ease with which I was able to get at least these few things right, was definitely a pleasant surprise.
